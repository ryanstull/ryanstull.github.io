My name is Ryan. I am currently working in the tech industry as a software engineer, while living in the New York area.

I've been programming since I was in high school, and I've always been very passionate about developing quality software. I recently completed my BS in Computer Science and Physics at Saint Joseph's University. My professional interests include application development, simulation, cyber security, and in general any cross disciplinary subjects between CompSci and Math/Physics.

Outside of work my interests include skiing, MMA, science and tech in general, piano, concerts, frisbee, and the shore*!
